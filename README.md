
angular-numeric-inputs is an Angular component designed for managing multi-digit numeric inputs. It is particularly useful for OTP (One-Time Password) input fields, where users need to enter a code split across several input fields. This component automatically handles navigation between fields and ensures only numeric input is allowed.

Features

Clears the current field when the backspace key is pressed.
Customizable number of input fields via inputCount input property.
Emits the complete numeric code as a single number when all fields are filled.
